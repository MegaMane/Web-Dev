It’s up to you to prevent the Mother Brain that controls Zebes from using the Metroid for evil purposes.  But that won’t be easy.  You’ll have to use your spacesuit to absorb valuable energy for your search to gain the use of power items like the Ice Beam, Wave Beam, High Jump Boots and Varia.  If you survive, it will be you and your acquired powers against the Mother Brain.\r\n\r\nWorth Noting: \r\nMetroid introduced nonlinear, side-scroller, maze-like, gameplay, in a platform, shooter. Metroid required players to discover permanent power-ups to progress further along; while backtracking through previously visited areas. The style is affectionately known as Metroid-vania' (Castlevania: Symphony of the Night being the second half to the term, mirrored the concept).\r\n\r\nMetroid also used a password system to resume progression of the game (Before the addition of battery backups and save files in console cartridges). Additionally the password system could be used for cheat codes: 'JUSTIN BAILEY ------ ------' (Just in Ballet) being famous, would remove Samus' power suit and start the player with many of the power-ups and fairly progressed through the game.\r\n\r\nCompleting the game in time and with enough power-ups revealed different endings. At the end Samus removes the helmet or power suit (depending) to a reveal a shocking suprise that endeared the character and broke new ground in gaming.",

The basic objective of the game is to guide lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.",
